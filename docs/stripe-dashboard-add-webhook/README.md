## Setting up the webhook

   - Click the `Developers` button (ðŸ”§) in the top left corner.

4. **Configure the Webhook Endpoint**:
   - Fill out the webhook details as follows:
     - **Endpoint URL**: Enter the URL of your service where Stripe will send event notifications.
     - **Description**: Provide a brief description of the webhook's purpose (e.g., "Production Payments Webhook").
     - **Listen to**: Leave this section as is unless you need to listen for [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/en-dk/connect) events.
     - **Select events to listen to**: Choose the events you want to be notified about. You can select all events, but this guide includes example implementations for `payment_intent.succeeded` and `account.updated`.
   - Click `Add endpoint` to save the configuration.

5. **Copy the Webhook Secret**:
   - After adding the endpoint, Stripe will generate a unique secret key. Copy this secret key, as you will need to add it to your environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
   - **Security Note**: Keep this secret safe and secure. It is used to verify that incoming webhook requests are genuinely from Stripe.
